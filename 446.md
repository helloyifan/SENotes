Be able to distinguish if something is Architecutre vs Design

Proxy / Surrogate

[Client] -> [Proxy] -> [Real Subject]

Example
document viewer, takes 2 seconds to open however takes 20 sseconds to load images
instead of waiting 20 seconds to load, it should open the document first and then load the image

[Client/image] -> [Proxy/filename] -> [image/data]


Details of the Proxy surrogate
- name
- intended use
- vocabulary
 - client
  - class or object that needs access to real subject
 - real subject
  -
 - subject
  - defines the common interface for real subject and interface
 - proxy
  - exactly like the actualy subject
  - which has same interface as Subject
- strucuture/ runtime
- consequences (advantages / disadantages)
 - Advantages
  - Virtual proxy and optimize for performance
  - Remote proxxy can hide location, client need not knoww where the day is coming form
  - in protection proxy you can ask for authentication
 - Disadvantage
  - Delay can be the problem can be over kill if its not necessary 
- NFPS
 - Improves performance eventhought 1 more step of stuff
 - Improves security

- Related Patterns
 - Adapter, the interface isnt exactly the same missing functionalities 	: unlike in proxy
 - Decorator pattern, you add more funtionality
 - You can say proxy is a special verion of the decorator pattern

##What is state pattern
* allows an objcet to change its behaviour
* depending on its internal state

Why
allow an object to change its behaviour depending on its internal state

Motivation / purpose 
a. large functionality
b. change behaviour at runtime

Advantage
* Low dependency
* easy to add behaviour
* improve cohesion
* code maintance

Disadvantage
* Class explosion - might end up with many classes that are really simliar
* Brittle context - new behaviour will change context class often


NFP
* is scalale
* is dependability 
* not efficient 

Example 

Vending Machines
* initally in idel state, customer inserts coin, vending is actviated, depending is the money is enough or not it'll change state to either insufficinent depoist or the sufficient depositiy state, and waiting for a selection, once the user make a seleciton,  the vending machine would change to the selected state and will return the product  and then move into the idle state again. The user did not change the contact state


##Facade
A simple interface to hide something behind it, face

Vocabulary 
* sub system: class and packages with complicated infomration
* facade : in french a face of the building that faces the street, to hide osmething behind it, access the subsystem with simple interface,
* client: user

Non-functional Properties
* Increased Usability
* Increased Scalability
* Reduced Complexity

Advantages  
* Hides implimentation details
* Easy/ Simple interface for clients
* Weak coupling

Disadvantage
* Clients cannot access underlying access
* No extra functionalities

Simliar  Patterns
* Adapter: Also creates a interface, but instead repuroses a interface instead of making a new one? Facade newly defines one
* Mediator: Simliar goal, attempts to abstract way a functionality, mediator seeks middle class to communicate other classe (multidirecional), Facade is one directional


##Observer Pattern

Strengths
* Supports the principle for loosely coupled designs
* sends data efficiently
* no modifications needed when
* add/remove obsersers at anytime

Weakness
* Sendinga message has copy
* order of notiaion is undependable

Example:
Whens there an update in piazza phone will listen to an update

NFP:
1. Flexiblity
2. Resilient

##Composite Design Pattern

Instead of overloading numbertimes for integer and real number and overloading functions , we can evalute expressions instead for an calculator 

Intended Use
* Recursive hierarchical tree structures
* Clients don't need to distinguish nodes from leaves
* Key: abstract
 classes that represent both nodes + leaves

Terms
* Component
* Primitive / leaf
* Composite / node
* Client

NFP
* Adaptability and Evolubiluity
* Complexity: simple
* High cohesion: each class accomplishs a single purpose
* Low coupling


Advantagegs
* Make clients code simple
* Not required to write specific code
* each to add new cases

Disadvantages
* Overly general classes
* Restic componetns of trees

Graphics is a good example: A line is a object, a dot is an object, you can both lines and dots to draw a smily face, which is not also a reusable object

Expressions look like primitive can be used as composite for other 

Realted Pattern
* Decorator
* Flyweight
* iterator
* Visitor

##Decorator Pattern

Add funcitonality of existing object

Modifies object by adding new functionality

More flexible then inteheritance (and simplier)

extendeds functionality

Only need to modify the decorator as opposed to every class

Keyword

* Decorator: the act of decorating  an object comes to modifying and existing object (Absttract class)
  * Topping
* Concrete Component: base class to add funtionality
  * Cheese Pizza
* Concrete Decorator: 
  * The actual type of topping (Pepperoni, Mushroom)
* Component
  * Finished pizza with stuff (Canadian Pizza)

The strenth of a decorator pattern is you can just define the toppings (pepperoni, mushroom), with inheritance you would have to define a class every type of pizza (one for canadian, one for peperoni)

Pros/Cons

Pros
* avoid infinitely many subclasses
* modify the same object dynamically

Disadvnatage
* makes process of initalization base object more complex
* hard to understand instances of decorators

NFA
Better performacne less classes
* but more base classes to manage

Extrememly scalable
* based on the fundamental concept of building a base object
* Extrememly evolvable over time, dymanically create infinitely many object
* Simple and efficient, allows behaviourable modifications during runtime


##Command Design Pattern

Command thats wrapped like an object
Invoker invokes Command which building a n command and sends it to the receiver 

Example:
Restuant with 

Waiter: Invoker (knows whats commands are and able to delegate it)
Cook:  Reciever (recieves command from invoker)
Bartender: Reciever
Customer: Client (Sends order to invoker)
Order: (Concrete Commands)

NFP
* Modularity
 * Maintainability / Debuggability
 * Abstraction / Extendability
 * Security

Pros
* Decreasing dependency and coupling of a system
* Makes it easier to undo/redo commands to maintain states
* New commands can be added ot the system easily

Cons
* Every command requeires an indenpendent class (more effort and implementation)

##Strategy Pattern

* Able to determine at runtime what to do, and go over to the location with the logic there
* avoid dependency of unrelated classes (burger and pasta wouldnt need to be close)

The strategy pattern, the logic is different, same family of algorithms are 
* Sorting is a great example , all take 1 as input and 1 as output and the way which it is done is different
* Command pattern, each function is differnt different output, so we can subclasses for different type of command
* Strategy pattern is the same input / output 

Advantage
* more options
* algorithms can be easily changed/ added
* can switch strategies at runtime
* Avoids duplicate code
* Elimiates coditional statements
* Can change implmentaion without affecting context 

Disadvantages
* Prior knowledge of strategies needed,
* Client must be awared of differnt strategies
* strategy base class must expose the interface
* Large memory reqeuired and performance impact
* Application needs to create and maintain two objects in the place of one

NFPs
* testability
* Extendability
* Maintanability
* Readability
* Reusability

Example using strategy vs not using it

When we decide to use a differnt algoerithm at runtime, if we didnt use startagy pattern, we would need to use a bunch of condtionals for each case, this can be avoided with strategy pattern, every new module of logic u add, you need only 1 new module of tests. avoids over branching, and this makes its very extendiable, instead of adding to chain of condtionals, you can add a module that add the funatioanlity, this also adds to the readabily as things are broken into smaller modules. Increases reusabulity instead of having large of condtionals, your newly created module can be reused.


Different Between

State
Decorator
Command

##Visitor

void main (){
  
  int is;   // compiler will chec that int is a known data types
  i = 0;    // compiler will check what we are storting in i is an integer  
  i = i + 1;  
  Print(i);
  return(0);

}


Compile will do type check and od syntax check
Compiler will have different operations and different operations are done on each line. It will do the same typechecks on everyline

What it does in typechecking in each line is different
What differes is the operation 

Advantage: 
* when a new functionality is added all we have to do add a new node 
* Gathers all simliar operation in one class

Disadvantage: 
* if the object strcutures changes, then we have to refactor all the subseqeunt node
