Irreative vs Recursive Navigation function

Pros n Cons of having the root name server to handle all requests

* caching
* can't cache all reqeusts, must need a smart performance handleing
* Alot of duplicate caching

A DNS client is called a resolver
- normally implemented as library s/w
- communitcates with one or more name servers
- simple req=reply protocal is used using UDP
- client implements timeout and resends query if necessary
- can configure resplves to contact an initial list of name servers

eg in some order of preferences
- the DNS architecture allows for iterative of recursive navigation 
- the resolver can specify which type of navigation is required when contracting a name server
  - but name server is not bound to follow this 
  - can have issues with tying up server threads
  - can pack multiple queries in a single msg (and can get multiple replies in a single msg)

Transport Protocal

What is a Transport porotcal
* Every network product follows a 5 layer 
* UDP and TCP is on transport layer
* Transport layer lets multiple applications use one network connection simultaneously

USER Datagram Protocol

Advanatesgs:
* Small packet sizes (Header size smaller)
* No connection to create and maintain
* More control over when data is sent out

Disadvantages
* Primitive error detection 
* When corrurption is detected it does not recover, but discard it
* No compensation for lost packets
* Packets can arrive out of order
* No congestion control

UDP is lightweight but unreliable

TCP
The reliable, connection based choice

Requires a three way handshake

Advantages
* Delivery acknowledgments
* Retransmissions (when a sender doesnt get a deliver acknowledgement it'll re send)
* In-order delivery (might be sent out of order, but TCP will rearrange)
* Congestion Control
 * Delays transmission when the network is congested
 * Error detection (checksum for IPV4 IPV6)

Disadantages
* Bigger header
* Data doesnt always get sent out immediaately
 * side effect of congestion control
* Bigget overhead
 * Retransmissions of packets, acknowledgement of packets (Not always a good thing)

 UDP is message-oriented
 * Application sends data in distinct chunkcs
 * See also: mail

 TCP is stream oriented
 * Used as a continuous flow of data
 * Split up in chuncks by TCP
 * See also: phone conversation

 For Text communication
 * since low bandwidth
 * and importance of the guaranteed deliver/in order delivery transmission TCP is favoured over UDP

 For downloading
 * TCP has in-order and resubmission
 * deliver acknowledgments

 For multimedia streaming
 UDP 
 * has less overhead
 * Send delay is undesirable but less delay
 * Data loss can be masked

 TCP:
 * Better when its overhead doesnt deteriorate perforamnce
 * Better secuity then UDP


 DNS lookuos
 * use UDP
 * no overhead
