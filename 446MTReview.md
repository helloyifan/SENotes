Final Will Cover

One type of question
* Advantage/Distadvantage of arch styles
 * Why it is true/untrue

**Sample Case study**:
System for a fighter Jet with 4 sensors

NFR/NFP of this system
* Reliability
 * Runs for 3000 hours without fail
* Efficiency
 * Responsiveness is regarded within one second
* Adaptability
 * System should be able to integrate different models of jets from 2016
* 95% of the features will be updatabled when connected to a secure line

Stakeholders
* Software developers
* Plots
* Management


Architecture Questions:

Component Diagrams

After completing an archeitrues diagram
* Justfiy how the NFPS are supported or unsupported by the diagram

* Justifying architerture chosesn
* Justifying architerture scalability

* Be able to violate your archeiture structure (Ie sensors not being able to talk with each other)
 * Given an architecutre style justify why its wrong
 * Example:
  * Prove why a layered architures style is bad for high performance
   * Bc added overhead at each layer
  * Prove why a layered archiecture is bad for software installed from CD

* Be able to compare strength / weaknesses of architectures / find differences 	
	* Event based vs Publish Subscribe
		* Simliarties vs differences
