**Why Software goes weong**

1. Segfaults / crashes / concurrency issues
2. Wrong API
3. System limitations- resources / perf
4. Improper input sanitization
5. Wrong output / bad specifications

TODO: All of the things above are considered regression

**Dealing with imprested software**

1. Disclaim Liability
2. Patch the Software
3. Defensive Programming (isolate from other parts of the system)
4. Replicate / backup user data

**Ways of Testing SW**

1. Compile it
2. Run it on one input
3. Run it on many input
4. Run it on a representative set of inputs
5. Run it on all inputs (static analysis)

#Lecture 2
Recall
**Fault:** staticdefect in the code
**Errors:** incorrect internal state
**Failures:** external (observed) incorrect behaviour

**Motivating Example**
In addition, If there is a train on the tract it would be an error

**RIP Fault model**
