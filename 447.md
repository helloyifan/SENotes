**Why Software goes wrong**

1. Segfaults / crashes / concurrency issues
2. Wrong API
3. System limitations- resources / perf
4. Improper input sanitization
5. Wrong output / bad specifications

TODO: All of the things above are considered regression

**Dealing with imprested software**

1. Disclaim Liability
2. Patch the Software
3. Defensive Programming (isolate from other parts of the system)re
4. Replicate / backup user data

**Ways of Testing SW**

1. Compile it
2. Run it on one input
3. Run it on many input
4. Run it on a representative set of inputs
5. Run it on all inputs (static analysis)

#Lecture 2
Recall
**Fault:** staticdefect in the code
**Errors:** incorrect internal state
**Failures:** external (observed) incorrect behaviour

**Motivating Example**
In addition, If there is a train on the tract it would be an error

**RIP Fault model**
To get from a fault to a failure:
1. Fault must be reachable
2. Program state after reacing fault must be incorrect: infection
3. Infected state must propagate to output to cause a visible failure

If you have all of these things then we can observe an error in our program

**Dealing with Problems**
avoidance: make it impossibe for people to do the wrong thing (ie avoid buffer overflow) [eg. by choice of programming language]
detection: via testing and verification 
tolerance: redundancy + isolation 

**Testing + debugging**
Testing: must find faults by providing inputs => observe a failture
* Discory of the program and its behaviour
Debugging: have the failure, need the fault => track down the error state
* Fix the fault (Engineering aspect)

---
#Lec 3

(a) Identify the fault, and ﬁx it.
* for loop condition should be i >= 0
(b) If possible, identify a test case that does not execute the fault.
* x = null causese NullPointerException before reaching fault
(c) If possible, identify a test case that executes the fault, but does not result in an error state.
* x = [2,3,5] but y = 3 or 5 
(d) If possible, identify a test case that results in an error, but not a failure. (Hint: program counter)
* look for something not in the array expected = -1 actual = -1
* Error State: in the final iteration,
 * Pc goes to "return 1"
 * instead of "if(x[i] == y)" line
(e) For the given test case, identify the ﬁrst error state. Be sure to describe the complete state
* PC is wrong again,
 * Same as case (d)
 
##Line Intersections

Test suits for intersect
* execute every statement (or every branch) in the method
* feed random inputs to intersect() 
 * unlikely to find the problem here 
* check all outputs of intersect()
 * ONE CASE TRUE, ONE CASE FALSE
* check T/F: a.x1 < b.x2 and a.x2 > b.x1
 * better than checking outputs
* check all "interesting" combinations of inputs
 * exhaustive testing
 
Inputs:
a = a.x1 
b = b.x1
A = a.x2
B = b.x2

* assume all 4 points distinct
 * if not : could have a = A, a = b, a = B
* assume a < b (we can switch when testing
* assime a < A b < B

Cases
* aBbB 
* abAB 
* abBA 

##Lec 4 Todo

##Lec 5

Last Time: Static vs dynamic analysis
* J Unit example
* coverage

This time Exploratory testing

Infeasible Test Requirements:
* TR:  cover every statement in the program
```
if (false)
    unReachableCall() // generates infeasible TR
```

```
while(0)
    { local_irg_disable()} // unreachable code in Linux Kernel    
```

Statements coverage can be infeasible for many programs

*Coverage level* = (Number TRs satisfied by test set T)/Number of TR

Exploratory Testing

"Explatory testing is simultaneous", learning test design and test execution

Explatory testing is good for:
* getting another perspective on the software
* combatting the silos in teh software design
* diversifying testing beyond scripts
* finding bad user experiences/ that most important bug quickly

Exploratory Testing Process
* Start with a goal/charter
 * explore the product elements of the software
* decide which area to test
* design a test  (informally)
* execute the test & kig bugs
* Repeat!

Output: brief notes that allow repro 
* Set of bug reports
* impresions + a summary of testing approach
* artifacts
 * inputs, outputs
 
* WW purpose: *
* Enable employees to post jobs + students to apply to jobs 
* 

*Main Features: *
* Create job postings
* Search for jobs 
* access control + authentication 
* schedule interviews

##Lec 6 
Waterloo works issues
* "accept" box on terms & conditions not visible because can't scroll
* unclear which term to select to see job postion,
* ambiguity in meaning of .... "current term"
* no validation for obviously incorrect term selection
* logout function doesn't actually logout

Overall
* looks nicer then Jobmine
* in 5 minutes, find some issues but no showstoppers
* improvements needed to user experience
* relatively mobile friendly

Control Flow graphs
* an intermediate representation of source code, suitable for analysis

Compilation
.c file sequences of bytes -(lexer eg NFAs)-> sequences of tokens "for"  "while" "strings" "etc"-(parser)-> syntax tree -(compiler / parser)-> control flow graph -> object code

CFG example:
 ```
               -------
               |x = 5|   //a cfg node-
               |z = 2|   // containts statements
               -------
                  |      //CFG edge summarizes permissible control- flow
                  V
               -----------                
               |if(z < 17)|
               -----------                

  |            // If false               |    //if true
  V                               V    
-----------                       |nop|
|z = z+ 1 |
|print (x)| //goes back to if dontions
-----------

```

Low-level code from CFG
```
x = 5
z = 2
q0: if(z < 17) goto q1
z = z+1
print(x)
goto qo
nop
```
Refer to hand out for CFG

##Lec 7

Statement + Branch Coverage (formally)

Definition Given a set of test requests TR for a graph criterion C,

a test set T satisfies C on graph G iff for every test requirenebt tr in TR. (test requirement), at least one test path P in (T) exists such that p satisfies tr 

Tests cases and test paths
* executing a test case t on a program, gives rise to test paths path(t)

Definition: A test path is a path P that starts at an initial node and ends at a final node.
* path(T) = {path(t)| t E T}

Example:
```
int foo(int x){      // ->               [if(x<5)]  (1)
    if(x<5){         //               if F    if T
        x++;         //              [x--] (3)    [x++] (2)
    }else{           //                 [return x] (4)
        x--;
    }
    return x
}
```

```
Test case
x = 7
Test path:
[1,3,4] // note we are missing statement 2
```

```
Test case
x = -3
Test path:
[1,2,4] // note we are missing statement 3
```
**Non determinism:**

```
           [if (xhashCode() > 3)]
        []                        []
                   []
  ```

Unlike the above example this is non-deterministic code, 
* for non-deterministic code one input may give different tests paths

Causes:
* dependences on
 * thread scheduler
 * time
 * memory layout

Definition for Branch and Statement Coverage: Given a set of test requiremnets TR for a graph criterion C, a test set T satisfies C on graph G iff for every test requirement tr in TR at least one test path p in path CT exists such that P satisfies tr.
 
Example: More abstract test graph n1....n6
* Keys note: you just need to have enough paths to reach all the statement (node) then it it under statement coverage

Test requirmemsnt for statemnet coverage : {n0,n1,n2,n3,n4,n5,n6}
* [n0, n1, n3, n4, n6]
* [n0, n1, n3, n5, n6]
* [n0, n2, n3, n4, n6]
* [n0, n2, n3, n5, n6]


SO: a test set T that satisfies statement coverage on D (where D is the graph) must include test cases t E T, t gives rise to path(t) some path must include each node n0...n6

Definition - Statement coverage
* For each node n E reachG(N0), TR containss a requrement to reach node n
* reachG : reachable node
* N0: initial node
* doesnt reach every reachable node just because there exists a path, we dont always meet the conditions to reach it

Example: Assume test case t,
    gives test case p1 = [n0, n1, n3, n4, n6]  //p1 = path(t1)

Test set {t1} does not give statment coverage  on D
* missing on n2, n5
* add test case t2, giveing test path P2 = [n0, n2, n3, n5, n6]
* Then {t1, t2} satisfies stattement coverage on D 

Other test sets that give statement coverage
* {t1, t2, t3 ,t4}
* {t1, t3 ,t4}
* {t3 ,t4}
* etc

Branch Coverage: TR contains each reachable path of length up to 1 (inclusive) in G, in the example
* (n0,n2) (n2,n3) (n3, n5) (n5,n6)
* (n0,n1) (n1,n3) (n3, n4) (n4,n6)

###Lecture 9
Recall: what statement coverage + branch coverage mean

First: given a graph + a criterion => set of Test Requirements

stmt coverage          branch coverage
 "visit node n0"       visit branch (n0, n1)
 "visit node n1"       visit branch (n1, n2)
                       visit branch (n1, n3)
 ... 
 "visit node nk"       visit branch (nk-1, nk)
 
 
 Notes: usually real test suits get 80% coverage
 * exceptions/error returns usually not well-tested
 * doesnt matter which coverage criterion you use in practice
 * coverage in itsself is insufficient to guarantee good code, but, be aware of what you don't cover
 
Criterion Complete Path Coverage:
 * TR contains all apths in G
 * Doesnt work (infeasible) for graphs wiht loops 
 * No prime paths in this course this year
 
Finite-state machines for Testing
* Higher level represenetation of system design
* best ones are generated manually

**Nodes = Software States(pages; values of key vars)**

**Edges = transition between states (something happens user enters command, time passes)**
  
Sometimes Edges come with preconditions/post conditions

See notes for better diagram: 

```
(login) ---[is anthenticated]---> (dashboard)
 
 [failed attempt loops back to login]
```

* enables systemic exokiratuib if systen behaviour
 * node coverage = visit every state
 * edge coverage = visit every transition
 
Definition: A round trip path is a paht of non-zero length with no internal cycles that start and ends at the same node

Criterion: Simple Round Trip Coverage
* TR contains at least one round-trip path for reach reachable node in G that beings and endsd a roundtrip path.

Definition: Complete Round trip coverage
* TR contains all round-trip paths for each reachable node in G that begins & ends a roundtrip paths

Deriving Finite- State Machines
* Aids your understanding of the sfotware
* May become stale
 * tools can help; iComment, Daikon
 
CFGs vs GSM
* Not very suitable:
 * CFD nodes abstract the PC only
  * good FSMs use more than PC for state
 * nondterminism due to virtual method calls  
 * need an implementation
 * large and unwieldy 

###Lec 10

```
Will attempt to automark A1Q1
- rerun mvn clean, mvn package
- check coverage %
- automatically scan for calls to assert *
with results from system under test
```

Where to get these FSMs?
* Software Structure/Specifications
 * requires lots of developer effort
 * need to understand the system
 * high-effort approach
 
modelling state
* choose relevant state variables and assign ranges to states 
* changes to state variables = transitions
* mode mech than specs/ software strucutre

Advantage of FSMs:
* Simplifies reality (advantage and disadvantage) = easier to analyze than the code 
* enables test design before implementation is available

Disadvantages
* mismatches w/ real artifacts
* abstract away useful information

Input based Testing- 
* reason directly about inputs to the system under test
* modify system under test to evaluate test suite (mutation testing)
 * figure out how good our test suite is
 
 ```
 Test things inside and boundary : 

xxx[ xxx (xx] xx) xxx

out side is invalid
[ ] is valid input
() denotes the bounary between valid input and invalid, Interesting things happen here
```
 
Example Perl expression:
```
14[0-9]{12}(?:[0-9](33)?$
= perl regexp for credit card visa #s
```
Generates syntactically valid #s

However, syntactically valid #s must satisfy checksum condition also

Generating inputs
* use regexp to generate syntactically valid numbers
 * filter into semantically valid/invalid
* modify regexp / grammar to generate almost-valid inputs
 * eg replace "12" by "11" to generate too short inputs

Grammars may be a better bet

Can use them for:
* generating inputs
* inside the program, to validate inputs

Requirements
* roll = actions
* action = deposit / debit
* dep = "deposit" account amount
* deb = "debit account amount
* account = dight  {3}
* amount = "$" digit + "." + digit {2}
* digit = ["0" - "9"]

Generating inputs with grammars for above requirments
* start with start production
* repace non terminals with their RHSs
 * get strnigs in input language
* repeat as needed
 * either randoly sample or exhaustive genetation
'''
                                   roll
                action                              action
                dep                                deb
                "deposit" acct amt                 "debit" acct amt    
                          "027" "$999.99"                  "447" "314.19"
'''

Example grammar from last time
roll = action*
action = dep|deb
dep = "deposite" account amount
deb = "debit" account amount
account = digit {3}
amount = "$"" digit "." digit {2}
digit = ["0"-"9"]

*We know how to generate strings in the language from the grammar
Question: how to generate invalid inputs?
eg."lizard" is an invalid input.

*Idea: modifying grammar -> gives you strings which are "almost" in the language.

*ASIDE: Hard to determine its termination:
void collect(int N){
  if (N == 1) {
    return;
  }
  if(N % 2 == 0){
    collect(N/2)
  }else {
    Collect(3N + 1)
  }
}

*What can we do to modify a grammar?
-Terminal replacement: 
swap out one terminal(eg. "$") for another (eg. "@")
-change multiplicity constraints
replace "+" with "*" or 3 with 4
-swap non-terminal ordering
e.g. account, amount in dep
-remove terminal/non-terminals
eg. remove "$" from amount
-add/duplicate terminals/non-terminals
eg. account = digit{3} action

*Two options for using mutated grammrs:
1. just generate inputs from mutated grammar
2. use original grammar, except once use the mutated grammar.

*Note:
1. grammars can also describe sequences of events.
2. Can still generate strings in language from mutated grammr
3. Grammars= syntactically valid/invalid inputs.
4. If your app accepts a subset of a larger language, try generating from the larger language.

***FUZZING: generating inputs via grammars. More on this next class.
*Example:
function test(){
  var f = function g() { //auto-generated by fuzzinator, crashes webkit
    if (this!=10) {
      f();
    }
  }
  var a = f();
}

test();

*First published instace:
Barton Miller, 1988
-simulate line noise -> unstructured ASCII input feed to unix utils.
-crushes 25-33% of unix utils.

*earlier: MacPaint, MacWrite (1983)
-"The monkey" generated random events.
-avoided quitting with "monkeylives" system flag.


Kinds of Fuzzing
* mutation-based
 * start wtih existing tests, modify then to explore new behaviours
* generating - based
 * generate new inputs from scratch

What to do with inputs?
 * give inputs to the program
 * Random bit stream (reg exp .*) random exp 0 more time
 * finds assertiion failures in webkit (webkit is rendering framework that is used by safari)


More sophisticated. C programs
1. Sequence of ASCII characters
2. Sequence of words, separators and white space
 * gets past the lexer
 * e.g no unclosed string
3. Syntatically correct C programs
 * must get past the parser 
4. Type cooect C programs
5. Statically conforming C programs
 * eg must have "main"
6. dynamically conforming C programs
 * eg. no write after free
7. model conforming C programs

As we go towards(7) we are more likely to find things specific to the system under test C complers

Mutation-based Fuzzing
* Randomly modify existing inputs
 * randomly flip bytes  (analogous to (1) above)
 * or, prase input + modify it according to grammar


Note: must still update checksums etc


Summary: Fuzzing is a useful technique for finding interesting test cases  
* + automatic, effective
* - need domain- specifc knowledge to find most interesting issues

Assignment 2

Q: random input generation 
	for iCalendar files 

Q2: mutation testing written question

Q3: a) generate  10 expressions
	b) minimizing test cases 
	c) automating test cases from (a)

Q4: abstract the test cses in Q3 and refactor using Page Objects

Mutating Testing

Two ways of using mutation testing:

1. evaluating coverage criteria
2. improving test suites


Definition: Ground string - a (valid) string belonging to the language of the grammar.

Definition: Mutation Opeator - a rule that specifies syntatic variations of strings generated from a grammar

Definition: Mutatn: the result of one application of a mutation operator to a ground string


* hard to apply by hand; automation is complicated
* is a "gold standard" that is a benchmark for other testing criteria


Mutation: manipulate ground (original program) strings to get mutants

note: 
* apply one mutation operator to ground string once to get a mutant
* conceptually, could try to apply every mutation operator everywhere, usually too much work!


Killing Mutants
* we have original program (ground string) mo
* apply mutation operator to get mutant m

Definition: Test case t  kills m if running t on m produces different output than running t on mo

Mutation score = % of mutants killed (given set of mutatns and a test suites)

can use mutation to improve a test suit by setting a target mutation score

Original:
```
int foo(int x, int y){
	if (x > 5) return x + y;
	else return x;

}

```


Mutant:

```
int foo(int x, int y){
	if (x > 5) return x - y;
	else
		return x;
}
```

test suite: 
x = 2, y = 4 // does not kill mutant (same output)

//now add
x = 6, y =2 // different outputs This test case skills the mutant


Workflow for mutation Testing
* generate mutants
 * valid programs which behave different from original 
* task: generate
 * tests that show they behave differently (eg thaat different kill mutants)


##Feb 6
Workflow for mutation Testing
* generate mutants
 * valid programs which behave different from original 
* task: generate
 * tests that show they behave differently (eg thaat different kill mutants)


Uninteresting mutatns
* still born -> does not compile/ crashes immediately
* trivial -> killed by almost any test case
* equivalent -> indistinguishable from original program

Example
```
int min(int a, int b){
	int minval; //replace with "unsigned int"
	minVal = a; //change to b

	if(b < a){ 	// possible mutation >= or something else
		//what if we added Bomb() which throws exceptions
		minVal = b; // change to +=, or replace b with "failOnZero(b)"
	}

	return minVal
}
```

Goals of mutation testing
1. mimic typical mistakes
2. encode knowledge about specific kinds of effective tests eg "must check for zero"


Mutation testing:
* while trying to kill mutants , you get what you actually want - tests that kill mutants

Strong vs weak mutants
* if the internal state is different, the test case weakly kills the mutants
* strong mutation - fault must propagate to output also
* example: change a ->b in 1st line. a = 5, b = 7 -> returns 5 in original 7 in mutant = strongly kills

```
a = 7 b = 5
    original program = 5
    mutant           = also 5
    internally different states after "minVal = a"
```

example 2:

replace `b < a` by `b < minval`
* no test case will strongly kill this mutant, it is equivalent
* or even weakly kill it

Integration Mutation
* Change parameter values in caller
* Change callee methods (call somethinge else
* Change inputs/outputs of callee

```
class M{
	int f,g;
	void c(int x){
		foo(x,g);  //change g to f
		bar(3, x); //change bar to foo
	}
	
	int foo(int a, int b){
		return a+b*f; //change to abs(a+b*f)
	}
	int bar(int a, int b){
		return a * b; //change a*b to a + b
	}
}

Then we looked at L16a-mutants-fse-talk-slides

##Feb 10

What did that "73%" from last time mean?

vs 50% for branch coverage
vs 40% for edge coverage

In that researhc, they found 300+ faults. 73% of faults could be found by tests generated by mutation testing
That is some mutant will be killed by a tests that detects a real fault

Then we looked at L16a-mutants-fse-talk-slides2 or something
