**Why Software goes weong**

1. Segfaults / crashes / concurrency issues
2. Wrong API
3. System limitations- resources / perf
4. Improper input sanitization
5. Wrong output / bad specifications

TODO: All of the things above are considered regression

**Dealing with imprested software**

1. Disclaim Liability
2. Patch the Software
3. Defensive Programming (isolate from other parts of the system)re
4. Replicate / backup user data

**Ways of Testing SW**

1. Compile it
2. Run it on one input
3. Run it on many input
4. Run it on a representative set of inputs
5. Run it on all inputs (static analysis)

#Lecture 2
Recall
**Fault:** staticdefect in the code
**Errors:** incorrect internal state
**Failures:** external (observed) incorrect behaviour

**Motivating Example**
In addition, If there is a train on the tract it would be an error

**RIP Fault model**
To get from a fault to a failure:
1. Fault must be reachable
2. Program state after reacing fault must be incorrect: infection
3. Infected state must propagate to output to cause a visible failure

If you have all of these things then we can observe an error in our program

**Dealing with Problems**
avoidance: make it impossibe for people to do the wrong thing (ie avoid buffer overflow) [eg. by choice of programming language]
detection: via testing and verification 
tolerance: redundancy + isolation 

**Testing + debugging**
Testing: must find faults by providing inputs => observe a failture
* Discory of the program and its behaviour
Debugging: have the failure, need the fault => track down the error state
* Fix the fault (Engineering aspect)
