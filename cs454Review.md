1 Middleware. 
* its role in dist computing/ systems
* advantages/disadvantages

2. Networks
* difference between circuit-switched and packet-switched networks
* ISO/OSI layers
* TCP UDP

3. In A2/A3 you dynamially assigned post $s 
a) why in basic networking services eg ssh http we use statically assigned port #s

b) what are the differences between persisted messaging and transient messging?

Pros/Cons of recursive name resolution of itterative name resolution
* Is it possible to replace one with the other
* what kind of protocol does DNS use?

5. DFS
- AFS vs NFS
- what kinds of msgs are sent in each 
- how is access transparency achieved?

6. Sychronization
- ACID
- 2pl, S-2pl, how locking/unlocking is done
- Timestamp based concurrency control



- Given distr transactions is each local history/schedule serializaable? What is the local history's ser orderder
Are the histories globally serializable

- What is the global serialization order? If not why not?

- Elections - how they are done and why
- Lamport ts: 	a -> b => ((a) < c(b))
what about 		a -> b <= ((a) < c(b)) 

7. Replication
- lazy vs eager
- data centric vs client centric consistency models
- quorum protocols conditions for forming read/write quorums


Design Vr. Vw. V

8. Differennce between reliability &  availability
* PC, failure, scenarios
* Unilateral abort
* understand that system is autonomous independent
* k-fault tolerance

Cloud and Data intensive dist computing
* what are the key characteristics of cloud environmental systems


MapReducess- understand computational Model
*  be able to write simple mapreduce funtion


60 % second half 40 % the first part
* seoocnd hlaf covered heaviery part
* something about every part
